            <h2 id="about-me-heading">About Me</h2>
            <p> <u>I come from...</u>
              I come from a lively household, growing up as the oldest sibling with two younger brothers. 
              That dynamic has shaped me as someone who organizes things and often steps in to mediate.<hr>
                <u>Passion:</u>
                I'm genuinely driven by the intersection of business needs and technical solutions. 
                I love seeing how information systems can make a tangible difference, whether it's designing the student benefits app 
                or building efficient tools for my own use.<hr>
                <u>Imagination:</u>
                I enjoy looking at current systems and imagining how they could be completely optimized. 
                That drive to envision something new is what fuels my personal coding projects, like creating a complex smart home setup or 
                designing a specific tracker to simplify a common task.
                and eat.<hr>
                <u>Teamwork:</u>
                Whether it's a family decision or a university group project, I genuinely enjoy working with others. 
                I find I work best when I can collaborate and bring different ideas together, focusing on getting everyone on the same page.</p>
